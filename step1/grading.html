<p>Name:   (please enter)</p>
<p>When you have completed the step assignment, complete the following form by entering numbers where the blanks are and compute your assignment grade. Include this file as page in your step web site.  Enter the number of points you deserve for each grading category. You may enter partial points if you feel you have partially completed the category.</p>
<p>Total available points:  100</p>
<p>For each item, if there is a request for the file and line number, indicate that as well so the TA can verify the code.</p>
<p>10______	10 	Submitted correctly (naming, grading page, etc.)

<p>100______	Total (please add the points and include the total here)</p>
<p>The grade you compute is the starting point for course staff, who reserve the right to change the grade if they disagree with your assessment and to deduct points for other issues they may encounter, such as errors in the submission process, naming issues, etc.</p>
<p>The rule for grading forms is this: If you indicate that you have done a task on the grading form and you have not actually done the task, the TA will deduct <strong>double the number of points</strong>. </p>
